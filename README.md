# Gameband
Ongoing reverse engineering efforts of the Gameband source code 
Decompiled with fernflower

## Contributing
Currently the source in `src/` is obfuscated, so it needs to be refactored into sensible names, and any bugs/modern java incompatibilities need to be fixed

## Mandatory disclaimer
The OpenGameband project is not associated in any way with NowComputing (however defunct they may be) and should this
project need to be taken down please email Zaprit<henry@vorax.org> and request the removal of the project.
